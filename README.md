# **House-price-predictions-in-Mexico**
I got the dataset for this project here [https://data.world/properati/real-estate-listings-mexico].The dataset contains housing data for mexico and it was
collected between 2013 and 2016.They are dowloaded as zipped files and they are two after unzipping. I did 
not upload the datasets because they are more than 150 mbs each. 
For this project, my interest was to understand how location,size of house and boroughs influenced price.
Check it out and give your suggestions. This is still a work in progress.
